## Excel dashboard for sales and profit
## Getting the Data Ready (using Power Query):
I thoroughly cleaned up and organized all the messy raw data.
Then, I brought together different data files into one easy-to-use place.

## Summarizing the Data (using Pivot Tables):
I used Pivot Tables to quickly summarize and check the important numbers.
This helped me see the main trends and patterns in the data right away.

## Designing the Dashboard's Look:
I explored many dashboard designs to get ideas and inspiration.
My main goal was to pick colors that look good together and make the dashboard easy on the eyes.
I made sure the design helps you quickly read and understand the data, so the numbers tell a clear story.
